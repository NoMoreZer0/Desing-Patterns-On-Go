	Posidet che takoe prochitat OOP

	Program to an interface, not an implementation

	Prefer composition over inheritance

	1. Strategy Pattern
			Sdelat snachala duck class
			Sdelat interface dlya performFly
			Sdelat dva otdelnix classa NoFly i MakeFly dlya letayushix i ne letayushix utok
			Napisat vnutri kazhdogo otdelnogo duck a interface
			Potom prost sdelat settor togo ili inogo classa interfaca dlya kazhdogo duck a


	Data is a crud oil

	new model: everybody can generate some data
	old model: few companies generating data all others are consuming

	Big Data can be analyzed to gather some insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves


	Data generation stages
		1. Opeartion and business system
			data is generated as a business activity (early passive)
		2. User-generated contant
			blogs, social media; mobile phones (active)
		3. Perception stage
			Sensor with processing capability,automatic; (7 * 24) This is the main reason for big data


	Four major technologies empower:
		- Big Data
		- AI
		- IoT
		- 5G

	only 20% data is structured and 80% is unstructured

	Structured Data
		- Can be displated in relational databases
		- Number, dates, string
		- Require less storage
		- Easier to manage and protect

	Unstructed Data
		- Cannot be displated in rows and columns
		- Images, audio, video
		- Requires more storage
		- More difficult to manageand protect with legacy solutions

	Structured Data
	Semi Structured Data -> some data with patterns
	Quasi Structured Data -> textual data has erratic formatcs. E.g clickstream Data
	Unstructured

	in Big Data your first have the Data. And then you think of schema to store the Data

	Jim Gray - a chel who created relationl databases

	3v - volume, velocity, variety

	volume
		- data scale increased 44 times from 2009 to 2040. From 0.8 zettabytes to ..

	Earth Scope
		more than 3.8 million squares of data and accumulating 67 tb data.

	variety
		- just the types of data. Text, Image, video etc

	velocity
		- Online Data Analytics
		Late deicison -> missing opportunities

	----------------------
	AI it is try to mimic our approach.

	Emergent behaviour - when a group behaves in ways that were not "programmed".

	Swarm Intelligence - trying to simmulate social interaction of the humans.
